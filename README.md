# Airbnb Rental Analysis

This project analyzes Airbnb rental data to gain insights into property characteristics and pricing.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about Airbnb rental properties over a fixed period. Key features include:

* **id:** Unique property identifier.
* **room_type:** Type of rental room (e.g., Entire home/apt, Private room, Shared room).
* **no_of_accommodates:** Number of adults the property can accommodate.
* **no_of_bathrooms:** Number of bathrooms in the property.
* **cancellation_policy:** Cancellation policy of the property (e.g., flexible, moderate, strict).
* **cleaning_fee:** Indicates whether a cleaning fee is included in the rent (True/False).
* **instant_bookable:** Indicates whether instant booking is available (True/False).
* **review_scores_rating:** Average review rating of the property.
* **no_of_bedrooms:** Number of bedrooms in the property.
* **no_of_beds:** Total number of beds in the property.
* **log_price:** Logarithm of the rental price (USD) for a fixed period. (log(price))

## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are to:

* Explore and understand the relationships between different property features.
* Analyze factors influencing rental prices.
* Identify trends in room types, cancellation policies, and review ratings.
* Gain insights into which factors most heavily influence the log price.
* Provide visual representations of the data and findings.

## Tools Used

* Microsoft Excel (for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization)

## Project Structure

* **`AIRBNB PROJECT.xlsx`:** The original Airbnb dataset.
* **`README.md`:** This file, providing project overview and instructions.

## Key Findings (To be populated after analysis)

* (Example: "Properties with more bedrooms tend to have higher log prices.")
* (Example: "Instant bookable properties have a higher average review score.")
* (Example: "The distribution of room types reveals that Entire home/apt is the most common.")
* (Example: "Cancellation policies have a visible effect on the price.")

## How to Use

1.  Download or clone the repository.
2.  Open `AIRBNB PROJECT.xlsx` to review the raw data.

## Future Enhancements

* Implement more advanced statistical analysis.
* Develop predictive models for rental prices.
* Expand the analysis to include geographical data.
* Use python and libraries like pandas, and matplotlib to improve the analysis.
* Create a dashboard.
