# 🏠 House Price Prediction - Real Broker Case Study

## 📌 Problem Statement

**Housing** is one of the most essential human needs. Over the years, the demand for housing has significantly increased due to rising standards of living. This growth reflects the importance of housing markets in positively influencing a country's economy.

**Real Broker** is a startup that enables customers to purchase or lease real estate, including houses, apartments, and land. The company employs professional auditors to collect and map all necessary elements for properties, such as:

- House features and specifications
- Geographic and neighborhood data
- Property values and market trends

Understanding these data points is crucial to helping consumers make informed decisions about real estate purchases.

As a **Data Analyst**, your task is to explore the provided dataset and extract actionable insights about the **factors that affect house prices in the US**.
